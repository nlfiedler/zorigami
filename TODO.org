*** TODO handle errors in getting Database ref in graphql handler
** Loose WebUI tasks

*** TODO consider l10n
**** c.f. https://resocoder.com/2019/06/01/flutter-localization-the-easy-way-internationalization-with-json/
*** TODO dataset status says "running" even though it had an error
**** need to expose the error status via GraphQL
*** TODO should sort the datasets so they are always in the same order
**** maybe sort them by date, with most recent first
*** TODO tree entries of =ERROR= type should be displayed as such
**** error message from =TreeEntry.new()= could be stored as a new type of =TreeReference=
***** e.g. =TreeReference.ERROR(String)= where the string is the error message
*** TODO datasets selector on home page should highlight current selection
**** need to keep selection state in =Datasets= component
*** TODO snapshots page needs controls to select snapshot to examine
*** TODO should have ui for listing all snapshots in a dataset
**** probably need paging in the ui and graphql api
*** TODO improve the page for defining datasets
**** TODO store selection should be easier for the user
**** TODO schedule input should be easier to use
***** user should not have to type ~@daily~ literally
**** TODO disable Save button until form is valid
**** TODO store input validator should check stores actually exist
**** TODO pack size should have minimum and maximum values
*** TODO improve the page for defining stores

***** c.f. https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref
*** TODO use breadcrumbs in the tree navigator to get back to parent directories
*** TODO improve the file restore user experience
**** rather than a direct download link,
**** use a GraphQL query to prepare the file on the backend,
**** and when it is ready, the frontend displays the download link,
**** and the file is retrieved from its temporary location,
**** and later the temporary file is removed
**** OTOH, "restore" could just put the file back where it belongs
*** TODO consider and improve accessibility
**** enable testing for a11y sanity
**** add hints to improve the presentation of information
***** configuration panel
***** snapshot browser
** More Functionality
*** TODO Perform a full backup on demand, discard all previous backups
**** Wifey doesn't like the idea of accumulating old stuff
**** Gives the user a chance to save space by removing old content
*** TODO Query to see histogram of file sizes, number of chunks, etc
**** for a given snapshot...
**** count number of files with N chunks for all values of N
*** TODO show details about snapshots and files
**** show differences between two snapshots
**** show pack/chunk metrics for   all   files in a snapshot
**** show pack/chunk metrics for changed files in a snapshot
*** TODO event dispatching for the web and desktop
**** use the state management to manage "events" and state
**** engine emits actions/events to the store
***** for backup and restore functions
***** e.g. "downloaded a pack", "uploaded a pack"
**** store holds the cumulative data so late attachers can gather everything
**** supervisor threads register as subscribers to the store
**** clients will use GraphQL subscriptions to receive updates
**** supervisor threads emit GraphQL subscription events
*** TODO consider how datasets can be modified after creation
**** should their stores be allowed to change?
**** should their basepath be allowed to change?
**** cannot change stores assigned to dataset once there are snapshots
*** TODO consider how to restore symbolic links
**** i.e. no file chooser to download anything
**** what if the same path is now a file/directory?
*** TODO Secure FTP improvements
**** TODO support SFTP with private key authentication
***** use store form to take paths for public and private keys
**** TODO allow private key that is locked with a passphrase
***** passphrase for private key would be provided by envar
** Architecture Review
*** Database migrations
**** Use the =serde= crate features (c.f. https://serde.rs)
**** Use =#[serde(default)]= on struct to fill in blanks for new fields
**** Add =#[serde(skip_serializing)]= to a deprecated struct field
**** New fields will need accessors that convert from old fields as needed
***** reset the old field to indicate it is no longer relevant
**** Removing a field is no problem for serde
*** Embedded Database
**** Is the default RocksDB performance sufficient?
**** Consider https://github.com/spacejam/sled/
***** written in Rust, open source
***** will need prefix key scanning
****** looks like you just use a prefix of the key (sorts before the matching keys)
*** Client/Server
**** Look at ways to secure the server, to allay fears of exploits
**** A web conferencing tool was exploited via its hidden HTTP server
** macOS support
*** TODO Use =launchd= to manage the process, have it start automatically
*** TODO Use this to replace Time Machine (store on server using minio)
** Full Restore
*** TODO Restore file attributes from tree entry
**** TODO File mode
**** TODO File user/group
**** TODO File extended attributes
*** TODO Restore directories from snapshot
**** TODO Directory mode
**** TODO Directory user/group
**** TODO Directory extended attributes
**** TODO Restore multiple files efficiently
**** TODO Restore a directory tree efficiently
*** TODO Detect and prune stale snapshots that never completely uploaded
**** Stale snapshots exist in the database but are not referenced elsewhere
*** TODO Support snapshots consisting only of mode/owner changes
**** i.e. no file content changes, just the database records
*** TODO Restore the backup database
**** TODO Restore to a different directory, then copy over records
** Windows support
*** TODO Support Windows file types
**** ReadOnly
**** Hidden
**** System
** More Better
*** TODO document how the user might change the passphrase over time
**** user must remember their old passwords in order to decrypt old pack files
**** the application will never store the actual password anywhere
*** TODO support database integrity checks
**** ensure all referenced records actually exist
**** like git fsck, start at the top and traverse everything
**** find and report dangling objects
**** an automated scan could be run on occasion
*** TODO Automatically prune backups more then N days old
**** For Google and Amazon, anything older than 90 days is free to remove
**** This would be a configuration setting, with defaults and path-specific
*** TODO Option to keep N daily, M weekly, and P monthly backups (a la Attic backup)
*** TODO Permit scheduling upload hours for each day of the week
**** e.g. from 11pm to 6am Mon-Fri, none on Sat/Sun
*** TODO Command-line option to dump database to json (separate by key prefix, e.g. ~chunk~)
*** TODO Ability to pause or cancel a backup
*** TODO Support deduplication across multiple computers
**** Place the chunks and packs in a seperate "database" for syncing
***** For RocksDB, use a column family if it helps with =GetUpdatesSince()=
**** RocksDB replication story as of 2019-02-20:
: Q: Does RocksDB support replication?
: A: No, RocksDB does not directly support replication. However, it offers
: some APIs that can be used as building blocks to support replication.
: For instance, GetUpdatesSince() allows developers to iterate though all
: updates since a specific point in time.
***** see =GetUpdatesSince()= and =PutLogData()= functions
**** User configures the host name of the ~peer~ installation
***** Use that to form the URL with which to =sync=
**** Share the chunks and packs documents with a ~peer~ installation
**** At the start of backup, sync with the ~peer~ to get latest chunks/packs
*** TODO Consider how to deal with partial uploads
**** e.g. Minio/S3 has a means of handling these
*** TODO Design garbage collection solution (see NOTES)
*** TODO Pack store should recommend pack sizes
**** e.g. Glacier recommends archives greater than 100mb
**** can only really make a recommendation, the user has to choose the right size
*** TODO Permit removing a store from a dataset
**** would encourage user to clean up the remote files
**** for local store, could remove the files immediately
**** must invalidate all of the snapshots effected by the missing store
*** TODO Permit moving from one store to another
**** would mean downloading the packs and uploading them to the new store
*** TODO Support Amazon S3
**** Minio seems to have no bucket limit (higher than 100)
**** Need to limit number of remote buckets to 100
**** Bucket limit: catch the error and handle by re-using another bucket
*** TODO Support Amazon Glacier
**** Need to limit number of remote buckets to 1000
**** Use S3 to store the database-to-archive mapping of each snapshot
**** Offer user option to use "expedited" retrievals so they go faster
*** TODO Support Amazon Cloud Drive
