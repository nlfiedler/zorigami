* Zorigami
** Phase 4
*** DONE Switch from warp to [[https://actix.rs][Actix]]
**** DONE Check for a testing library or integration
**** DONE Check for integration with Juniper
**** DONE Learn how to do the same things with Actix as we have in =main.rs=
**** DONE Separate the GraphQL schema code into =schema.rs= (like juniper example)
**** DONE Need to use =1.0.0-beta3= to use juniper example
**** DONE Serve the static files
**** DONE Add support for GraphQL
***** c.f. https://github.com/actix/examples/tree/master/juniper
**** DONE Use the actix logging middleware
*** DONE Update to latest rusoto 0.38
*** TODO Design for storing the same pack to multiple stores
**** for replicaz, want to store packs to local disk and SFTP
**** single dataset that stores packs to multiple locations
***** e.g. one store for local, another for SFTP
***** need a multi store that has the names for the other stores
***** =store_pack()= returns a struct that holds remote coordinates
***** =record_completed()= stores that remote coordinates struct in =SavedPack=
***** multi store will use simple algorithm to choose best store for retrieval (i.e. local is preferred)
***** multi store should try to store concurrently
***** pack records need to have list of remote coordinates, keyed by store name
*** TODO Should store chunks in pack file in sorted order to produce same results every time
*** DONE Consider how multiple datasets pointing at the same root will work
**** What if one file changes for each, producing an identical pack file?
**** Should check if a pack already exists in the database before storing
*** TODO Design for database migrations
**** move the old struct implementations into a separate, versioned module
**** use the old structs to deserialize and convert to the new struct
*** TODO Develop the GraphQL schema to represent everything
**** snapshots
**** files
**** trees
**** stores
**** store configuration
***** model each store config as a type in GraphQL?
***** devise a custom type that is encoded JSON?
***** or config is a list of name/value pairs?
*** TODO Document the database schema
**** [[http://cbor.io][RocksDB]] key/value store
**** [[http://cbor.io][CBOR]] values
**** keys have type prefixes (e.g. =chunk/=)
**** values are name/value pairs of object properties
*** TODO Write a ReasonML frontend
**** TODO Add =bs-platform= dependency and =bsconfig.json= file
**** TODO Put front-end code in a directory named =web-src=
**** TODO Set up =gulp= and =webpack= to build the front-end code
**** TODO Set up apollo client dependency and schema tooling
**** TODO Set up the routing
**** TODO Write a simple home page that shows something
*** TODO Recover from unfinished backup procedure
**** When performing backup, check if latest snapshot exists and lacks an end time
**** If so, try to continue the backup with that snapshot
**** If not, make a new snapshot
**** If there are no changes at all (tree or file), delete the snapshot
*** TODO Manage stores, datasets, and configuration
*** TODO Exclude the database files from the data set(s)
*** TODO Add something that will run scheduled jobs

***** DONE decide how to store "documents" in the database
****** use [[https://github.com/serde-rs/serde][serde]] to efficiently de/serialize to many formats
****** can =skip= fields that do not need serde
****** can write custom serde functionality as needed
****** DONE how to manage versioning of the data structures?
******* can use =#[serde(default)]= and =Default= to fill in blanks
****** =serde_json= is maintained by serde community
****** [[https://github.com/pyfisch/cbor][pyfisch/cbor]]; CBOR is an internet standard (RFC 7049)
****** [[https://github.com/3Hren/msgpack-rust][3Hren/msgpack-rust]] is not actively developed
***** DONE Use serde ~rename~ feature to make short field names
***** DONE write functions for insert/get tree
***** DONE write functions for insert/get snapshot
***** TODO write functions for insert/get configuration
***** DONE write functions for insert/get xattr
***** DONE write functions for insert/get file
***** DONE write functions for insert/get chunk
***** DONE write functions for insert/get pack
***** DONE work out how to support the counts of each type of document
***** DONE decide how the chunk and pack records will be stored to facilitate multi-host dedupe
**** TODO consider approaches for managing the database instance
***** engine opens at start of backup procedure, drops when done
***** Actix has shared state management
***** maybe use =Arc= and =Mutex= to manage concurrent access
** Phase 5

**** TODO File user/group
**** TODO File extended attributes
*** TODO Restore directories from snapshot
**** TODO Directory mode
**** TODO Directory user/group
**** TODO Directory extended attributes
**** TODO Restore multiple files efficiently
**** TODO Restore a directory tree efficiently
*** TODO Detect files changing between snapshot and pack building time
**** use the =changed= record property to track this
*** TODO Detect file deletion during backup, mark file record as skipped
*** TODO Detect and prune stale snapshots that never completely uploaded
**** Stale snapshots exist in the database but are not referenced elsewhere
*** TODO Support snapshots consisting only of mode/owner changes
**** i.e. no file content changes, just the database records
*** TODO Restore the backup database
**** TODO Restore to a different directory, then copy over records
*** TODO Support deduplication across multiple computers
**** Place the chunks and packs in a seperate "database" for syncing
***** For RocksDB, use a column family if it helps with =GetUpdatesSince()=
**** RocksDB replication story as of 2019-02-20:
: Q: Does RocksDB support replication?
: A: No, RocksDB does not directly support replication. However, it offers
: some APIs that can be used as building blocks to support replication.
: For instance, GetUpdatesSince() allows developers to iterate though all
: updates since a specific point in time.
***** see =GetUpdatesSince()= and =PutLogData()= functions
**** Use the express support in [[https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb-server][pouchdb-server]] to serve up chunks/packs db
**** User configures the host name of the ~peer~ installation
***** Use that to form the URL with which to =sync=
**** Share the chunks and packs documents with a ~peer~ installation
**** At the start of backup, sync with the ~peer~ to get latest chunks/packs
*** TODO Automatically prune backups more then N days old
**** For Google and Amazon, anything older than 90 days is free to remove
**** This would be a configuration setting, with defaults and path-specific
*** TODO Option to keep N daily, M weekly, and P monthly backups (a la Attic backup)
*** TODO Command-line option to dump database to json (separate by key prefix, e.g. ~chunk~)
** Phase 7

*** TODO Design garbage collection solution (see NOTES)
*** TODO Support Windows file types
**** ReadOnly
**** Hidden
**** System
*** TODO Support SFTP with private key authentication
